## Abstract
To enhance road safety and prevent accidents, this project focuses on developing a system to detect abnormal activities on roads in real-time. With YOLOv8, an object detection model, our approach aims to identify various irregularities such as accidents, reckless driving, and pedestrian crossings. Through a comprehensive training process and fine-tuning of the YOLOv8 model, we adapt it to the specific requirements of road safety monitoring. At the beginning of the configuration, we discuss combining Flask for web application development and Cloudinary for video storage which provides the user with user authentication, video processing, and streaming. In the end, it detects the specific objects in a video stream, records segments of the video when these objects are detected, and then uploads the recorded segments to Cloudinary
